abstract = {An accurate first-principles treatment of chemical reactions for large systems remains a significant challenge facing electronic structure theory. Hybrid models, such as quantum mechanics:molecular mechanics (QM:MM) and quantum mechanics:quantum mechanics (QM:QM) schemes, provide a promising avenue for such studies. For many chemistries, including important reactions in materials science, molecular mechanics or semiempirical methods may not be appropriate, or parameters may not be available (e.g., surface chemistry of compound semiconductors such as indium phosphide or catalytic chemistry of transition metal oxides). In such cases, QM:QM schemes are of particular interest. In this work, a QM:QM electronic embedding model within the ONIOM (our own N-layer integrated molecular orbital molecular mechanics) extrapolation framework is presented. To define the embedding potential, we choose the real-system low-level Mulliken atomic charges. This results in a set of well-defined and unique embedding charges. However, the parametric dependence of the charges on molecular geometry complicates the energy gradient that is necessary for the efficient exploration of potential energy surfaces. We derive an efficient form for the forces where a single set of self-consistent field response equations is solved. Initial tests of the method and key algorithmic issues are discussed.},

@article{Biancardi2016,
abstract = {Hybrid quantum mechanical methods can assist in the interpretation and prediction of the electronic spectra of large molecular structures. In this work, we study the performance of the ONIOM (Our own N-layered Integrated molecular Orbital molecular Mechanics) hybrid method for the calculation of transition energies and oscillator strengths by embedding the core region in a field of fixed point charges. These charges introduce polarization effects from the substituent groups to the core region. We test various charge definitions, with particular attention to the issue of overpolarization near the boundary between layers. To minimize this issue, we fit the charges on the electrostatic potential of the entire structure in the presence of the link atoms used to cap dangling bonds. We propose two constrained fitting strategies: one that produces an average set of charges common to both model system calculations, EE(L1), and one that produces two separate sets of embedding charges, EE(L2). The results from our tests show that indeed electronic embedding with constrained-fitted charges tends to improve the performance of ONIOM compared to non-embedded calculations. However, the EE(L2) charges work best for transition energies, and the EE(L1) charges work best for oscillator strengths. This may be an indication that fixed point charges do not have enough flexibility to adapt to each system, and other effects (e.g., polarization of the embedding field) may be necessary.},

ChemRxiv. Preprint. Understanding photoinduced processes in molecular crystals is central to the design of highly emissive materials such as organic lasers and organic light-emitting diodes. The modelling of such processes is, however, hindered by the lack of excited state methodologies tailored for these systems. Embedding approaches based on the Ewald sum can be used in conjunction with excited state electronic structure methods to model the localised excitations which characterise these materials. In this article, we describe the implementation of a two-level ONIOM(QM:QM') point charge embedding approach based on the Ewald method, the Ewald Embedded Cluster (EEC) model. An alternative self-consistent method is also considered to simulate the response of the environment to the excitation. Two molecular crystals with opposing photochemical behaviour were used to benchmark the results with single reference and multireference methods. We observed that the inclusion of an explicit ground state cluster surrounding the QM region was imperative for the exploration of the excited state potential energy surfaces. Using EEC, accurate absorption and emission energies as well as S1-S0 conical intersections were obtained for both crystals. We discuss the implications of the use of these embedding schemes considering the degree of localisation of the excitation. The methods discussed herein are implemented in an open source platform (fromage, https://github.com/Crespo-Otero-group/fromage) which acts as an interface between popular electronic structure codes (Gaussian, Turbomole and Molcas).

This large database of structures is used to assess the relative importance of short-range (exchange, overlap, orbital) and long-range (Coulombic) excitonic coupling. We find that Mulliken atomic transition charges can introduce systematic errors in the Coulombic coupling and that the dipole−dipole interaction fails to capture the true Coulombic coupling even at intermolecular distances of up to 50 {\AA}. The non-Coulombic short-range contribution to the excitonic coupling is found to represent up to ∼70{\%} of the total value for molecules in close contact, while, as expected, it is found to be negligible for dimers not in close contact. For the face-to-face dimers considered here, the sign of the short-range interaction is found to correlate with the sign of the Coulombic coupling, i.e. reinforcing it when it is already strong.

abstract = {In molecular mechanics (MM) studies, atom types and/or bond types of molecules are needed to determine prior to energy calculations. We present here an automatic algorithm of perceiving atom types that are defined in a description table, and an automatic algorithm of assigning bond types just based on atomic connectivity. The algorithms have been implemented in a new module of the AMBER packages. This auxiliary module, antechamber (roughly meaning "before AMBER"), can be applied to generate necessary inputs of leap-the AMBER program to generate topologies for minimization, molecular dynamics, etc., for most organic molecules. The algorithms behind the manipulations may be useful for other molecular mechanical packages as well as applications that need to designate atom types and bond types. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract  ="Aggregation induced emission offers a route to the development of emissive technologies based on solely organic systems. However{,} maximising fluorescence quantum efficiencies (QE) is a formidable challenge in attaining first-principles materials design{,} due to the interplay between the electronic structure of the chromophore and the morphology of the material. The identification of radiative and nonradiative channels{,} and how these are affected by aggregation{,} can rationalise emissive properties and aid in the design of yet more efficient fluorophores in the condensed phase. In the current work{,} we examine the mechanism behind the solid state luminescence enhancement in two related families of compounds with lasing properties{,} which undergo excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). We systematically investigate competing excited state decay channels in a total of eleven crystals to evaluate the factors needed for efficient ESIPT fluorophores{,} aided by a full evaluation of the crystal structures{,} exciton coupling{,} and exciton hopping rates. We show that in addition to the restriction of nonradiative pathways{,} an efficient ESIPT is essential to maximise the QE in the solid state. This extensive study of structure–property relationships for fluorophores based on the ESIPT mechanism bridges the understanding of molecular photophysics with crystal structure{,} accelerating the development of highly efficient solid state emitters."}

The algorithm has been employed for computing time‐averaged volumes in the hydrated crystal of met‐myoglobin, using the data of a molecular dynamics simulation. The results, compared to previous volume determination in myoglobin, emphasize the fundamental role of solvent structure close to the protein surface in relation to the packing density properties of the residues. Relative volumes fluctuations of myoglobin residues have been found to be correlated to the corresponding mean square displacements from X‐ray diffraction studies and to the theoretical hydration energies.

@article{Hunjan2010,
abstract = {The Voronoi volume of simple fluids was previously made use of in connection with volume transport phenomena in nonequilibrium simple fluids. To investigate volume transport phenomena, it is important to develop a method to compute the Voronoi volume of fluids in nonequilibrium. In this work, as a first step to this goal, we investigate the equilibrium limit of the nonequilibrium Voronoi volume together with its attendant related molar (molal) and specific volumes. It is proved that the equilibrium Voronoi volume is equivalent to the molar (molal) volume. The latter, in turn, is proved equivalent to the specific volume. This chain of equivalences provides an alternative procedure of computing the equilibrium Voronoi volume from the molar volume/specific volume. We also show approximate methods of computing the Voronoi and molar volumes from the information on the pair correlation function. These methods may be employed for their quick estimation, but also provide some aspects of the fluid structure and its relation to the Voronoi volume. The Voronoi volume obtained from computer simulations is fitted to a function of temperature and pressure in the region above the triple point but below the critical point. Since the fitting function is given in terms of reduced variables for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) model and the kindred volumes (i.e., specific and molar volumes) are in essence equivalent to the equation of state, the formula obtained is a reduced equation state for simple fluids obeying the LJ model potential in the range of temperature and pressure examined and hence can be used for other simple fluids. ? 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format.

@article{Schirmer2004,
abstract = {Propagator methods provide a direct approach to energies and transition moments for (generalized) electronic excitations from the ground state, but they do not usually allow one to determine excited state wave functions and properties. Using a specific intermediate state representation (ISR) concept, we here show how this restriction can be overcome in the case of the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) propagator approach. In the ISR reformulation of the theory the basic ADC secular matrix is written as a representation of the Hamiltonian (or the shifted Hamiltonian) in terms of explicitly constructable states, referred to as intermediate (or ADC) states. Similar intermediate state representations can be derived for operators other than the Hamiltonian. Together with the ADC eigenvectors, the intermediate states give rise to an explicit formulation of the excited wave functions and allow one to calculate physical properties of excited states as well as transition moments for transitions between different excited states. As for the ground-state excitation energies and transition moments, the ADC excited state properties are size consistent so that the theory is suitable for applications to large systems. The established hierarchy of higher-order [ADC(n)] approximations, corresponding to systematic truncations of the IS configuration space and the perturbation-theoretical expansions of the ISR matrix elements, can readily be extended to the excited state properties. Explicit ISR matrix elements for arbitrary one-particle operators have been derived and coded at the second-order [ADC(2)] level of theory. As a first computational test of the method we have carried out ADC(2) calculations for singlet and triplet excited state dipole moments in H(2)O and HF, where comparison to full CI results can be made. The potential of the ADC(2) method is further demonstrated in an exploratory study of the excitation energies and dipole moments of the low-lying excited states of paranitroaniline. We find that four triplet states, T1-T4, and two singlet states, S1 and S2, lie (vertically) below the prominent charge transfer (CT) excitation, S3. The dipole moment of the S3 state (17.0D) is distinctly larger than that of the corresponding T3 triplet state (11.7D).},

abstract = {The electronic excitation spectrum of pyrrole is studied using a polarization propagator method referred to as the second-order algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)), along with a simple model for vibrational excitation accounting for all totally symmetric modes. The method describes the optical absorption profile of pyrrole with an expected accuracy of 0.2-0.4 eV for the vertical excitation energies. The vibrational analysis provides for detailed additional spectroscopic information. In the singlet spectrum, besides the ns, np and nd (n = 3,4) Rydberg excitations, three $\pi$-$\pi$ * valence transitions, V′(1A1), V(1B2) and V(1A1) can clearly be distinguished. No evidence is found for Rydberg-valence interaction near the equilibrium geometry. Substantial vibrational widths and distinct vibrational excitation patterns are predicted for the Rydberg series converging to the first and second ionization thresholds. Some new assignments of major spectral features are proposed. The long-wave absorption maximum in the 5.6-6.6 eV region is explained exclusively by the presence of Rydberg transitions, while the most intense absorption in the short-wave band system (7.0-8.2 eV) predominantly originates from the V(1B2) and V(1A1) valence transitions.},

@article{Hartree1935,
abstract = {Except for the lightest atoms, most calculations of approximate wave functions and fields for many-electron atoms have been carried out by the method of the “self-consistent field,” of which the principle is, shortly, the determination of a set of one-electron wave functions such that each represents a stationary state of an electron in the field of the nucleus and the Schr{\"{o}}dinger charge distribution of the electrons occupying the other wave functions of the set. This method has been found quite practicable for numerical work, even for the heaviest atoms. As so far applied, it involves three main approximations, namely, ( a ) neglect of relativity and spin effects, ( b ) neglect of exchange effects, and ( c ) treatment of the wave function of the whole atom as built up of functions of the co-ordinates of the individual electrons only, its depen­dence on the mutual distances between every pair of electrons being neglected; or, in other words, each electron is replaced by a statistical average distribution, in calculating its effect on the other electrons on the atom.},

A new semi-empirical method is proposed, therefore, in terms of equivalent orbitals. The equations obtained, which do have the usual form, are applicable to a large class of molecules and do not involve the approxima­ tions that were thought necessary. In this method the ionization potentials are calculated by treating certain integrals as semi-empirical parameters. The value of these parameters is discussed in terms of the localization of equivalent orbitals and some approximate rules are suggested. As an illustration the ionization potentials of the paraffin series are considered and good agreement between the observed and calculated values is found.},

The result of these efforts is that nowadays, PCM, with all its different variants, is the default choice in many computational codes to couple a quantum-mechanical (QM) description of a molecular system with a continuum description of the environment. In this review, a brief presentation of the main methodological and computational aspects of the method will be given together with an analysis of strengths and critical issues of its coupling with different QM methods. Finally, some examples of applications will be presented and discussed to show the potentialities of PCM in describing the effects of environments of increasing complexity. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

These factors include the quantum mechanical energies associated with bond cleavage and charge redistribution of the substrate and the classical energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The electrostatic polarization of the enzyme atoms and the orientation of the dipoles of the surrounding water molecules is simulated by a microscopic dielectric model. The solvation energy resulting from this polarization is considerable and must be included in any realistic calculation of chemical reactions involving anything more than an isolated molecule in vacuo. Without it, acidic groups can never become ionized and the charge distribution on the substrate will not be reasonable. The same dielectric model can also be used to study the reaction of the substrate in solution. In this way the reaction in solution can be compared with the enzymic reaction.},

This method, which does not require any new parameter, evaluates explicitly the energy derivatives with respect to geometrical parameters and therefore has a straightforward application to geometry optimization.

abstract = {The new ONIOM (our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics) approach has been proposed and shown to be successful in reproducing benchmark calculations and experimental results. ONIOM3, a three-layered version, divides a system into an active part treated at a very high level of ab initio molecular orbital theory like CCSD(T), a semiactive part that includes important electronic contributions and is treated at the HF or MP2 level, and a nonactive part that is handled using force field approaches. The three-layered scheme allows us to study a larger system more accurately than the previously proposed two-layered schemes IMOMO, which can treat a medium size system very accurately, and IMOMM, which can handle a very large system with modest accuracy. This three-layered scheme has been applied to activation barriers for the Diels-Alder reaction of acrolein + isoprene, acrolein + 2-tert-butyl-1,3-butadiene, and ethylene + 1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,3-butadiene. In general, the results for both geometry optimizations and single point energy calculations agree well with benchmark predictions and experimental results. The scheme has also been applied to the transition state for the oxidative addition of H2to Pt(P(f-Bu)3)2. The activation energy of this 83-atom reaction is predicted to be 14.2 kcal/mol with the ONIOM3(CCSD(T):MP2:MM3) method. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Chemical Society.},

We identify the bubbles in the system by means of a Voronoi-based analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories. By comparing the features of the tessellation of liquid water at ambient conditions to those of the same system with an empty cavity we are able to discriminate vapor (or interfacial) molecules from the bulk ones. This information is used to follow the time evolution of the largest bubble until the system cavitates at 280 K above and below the spinodal line. At the pressure above the spinodal line, the MFPT curve shows the expected shape for a moderately metastable liquid from which we estimate the bubble nucleation rate and the size of the critical cluster. The nucleation rate estimated using Classical Nucleation Theory turns out to be about 8 order of magnitude lower than the one we compute by means of MFPT. The behavior at the pressure below the spinodal line, where the liquid is thermodynamically unstable, is remarkably different, the MFPT curve being a monotonous function without any inflection point.},

abstract = {Despite its relevance in biology and engineering, the molecular mechanism driving cavitation in water remains unknown. Using computer simulations, we investigate the structure and dynamics of vapor bubbles emerging from metastable water at negative pressures. We find that in the early stages of cavitation, bubbles are irregularly shaped and become more spherical as they grow. Nevertheless, the free energy of bubble formation can be perfectly reproduced in the framework of classical nucleation theory (CNT) if the curvature dependence of the surface tension is taken into account. Comparison of the observed bubble dynamics to the predictions of the macroscopic Rayleigh--Plesset (RP) equation, augmented with thermal fluctuations, demonstrates that the growth of nanoscale bubbles is governed by viscous forces. Combining the dynamical prefactor determined from the RP equation with the free energy of CNT yields an analytical expression for the cavitation rate that reproduces the simulation results very well over a wide range of pressures. Furthermore, our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with cavitation rates obtained from inclusion experiments. This suggests that homogeneous nucleation is observed in inclusions, whereas only heterogeneous nucleation on impurities or defects occurs in other experiments.},

abstract = {General formalism of absorption and emission spectra, and of radiative and nonradiative decay rates are derived using a thermal vibration correlation function formalism for the transition between two adiabatic electronic states in polyatomic molecules. Displacements, distortions, and Duschinsky rotation of potential energy surfaces are included within the framework of a multidimensional harmonic oscillator model. The Herzberg-Teller (HT) effect is also taken into account. This formalism gives a reliable description of the Qx spectral band of free-base porphyrin with weakly electric dipole-allowed transitions. For the strongly dipole-allowed transitions, e.g., S1 → S0 and S0 → S1 of linear polyacenes, anthracene, tetracene, and pentacene, the HT effect is found to enhance the radiative decay rates by ∼10{\%} compared to those without the HT effect. For nonradiative transition processes, a general formalism is presented to extend the application scope of the internal conversion theory by going beyond the promoting-mode approximation. Numerical calculations for the nonradiative S1 → S0 decay rate of azulene well explain the origin of the violation of Kashas rule. When coupled with first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the present approach appears to be an effective tool to obtain a quantitative description and detailed understanding of spectra and photophysical processes in polyatomic molecules. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

The linear-scaling methods proposed to date can be divided into seven different areas, and the applicability, efficiency and advantages of the methods proposed in these areas are then discussed. The applications of linear-scaling methods, as well as the implementations available as computer programs, are considered.

@article{Siegbahn1981,
abstract = {The complete active space (CAS) SCF method is presented in detail with special emphasis on computational aspects. The CASSCF wave function is formed from a complete distribution of a number of active electrons in a set of active orbitals, which in general constitute a subset of the total occupied space. In contrast to other MCSCF schemes, a CASSCF calculation involves no selection of individual configurations, and the wave function therefore typically consists of a large number of terms. The largest case treated here includes 10 416 spin and space adapted configurations. To be able to treat such large CI expansions, a density-matrix oriented formalism is used. The Newton-Raphson scheme is applied to calculate the orbital rotations, and the secular problem is solved with recent developments of CI techniques. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in calculations on the HNO molecule in ground and excited states, using a triple-zeta basis and different sizes of the active space. With a reasonable choice of active space, the calculations converge in 6-10 iterations. This is true also for states which are not the lowest state of the symmetry in question. The equilibrium geometry for the ground state is RNO=1. 215(1.212) {\AA}, RNH=1.079(1.063) {\AA}. $\theta$HNO= 108.8(108.6)°, the experimental values given in parenthesis for comparison. The best estimates for the transition energies to the lowest 3A″ and 1A″ states are 0.67(0.85) eV and 1.52(1.63) eV, respectively. The results obtained indicate that the choice of active space may be crucial for the convergence properties of CASSCF calculations. {\textcopyright} 1981 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Seifert2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we review the foundations of the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method. The method is based on the density-functional theory as formulated by Hohenberg and Kohn. It introduces several approximations: First, densities and potentials are written as superpositions of atomic densities and potentials. Second, many-center terms are summarized together with nuclear repulsion energy terms in a way that they can be written as a sum of pairwise repulsive terms. For small distances, the nuclear repulsion dominates, whereas for large distances, these terms vanish. The Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in a set of localized atom-centered functions. They are represented in a minimal basis of optimized atomic orbitals, which are obtained for spherical symmetric spin-unpolarized neutral atoms self-consistently. The whole Hamilton and overlap matrices contain one- and two-center contributions only. Therefore, they can be calculated and tabulated in advance as functions of the distance between atomic pairs. In addition, we discuss a self-consistent charge extension, the treatment of weak interactions, and a linear response scheme in connection with the DFTB method. Finally, some practical aspects are presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

We also consider some conditions for the definition of an approximately diabatic electronic basis. For molecular systems with three or more nuclei, one can obtain useful approximate diabatic basis sets if the transverse (solenoidal) part of the coupling is negligible; this may occur, for example, if the part of the coupling due to the internuclear‐distance dependence of the configurational wave functions is negligible as compared to that due to the internuclear‐distance dependence of the configurational coefficients.

The influence of molecular packing on basic optical probes like absorption and photoluminescence was originally worked out by Kasha for aggregates dominated by Coulombic intermolecular interactions, eventually leading to the classification of J- and H-aggregates. This review outlines advances made in understanding the relationship between aggregate structure and photophysics when vibronic coupling and intermolecular charge transfer are incorporated. An assortment of packing geometries is considered from the humble molecular dimer to more exotic structures including linear and bent aggregates, two-dimensional herringbone and “HJ” aggregates, and chiral aggregates.

@article{dirac1927,
abstract = {Intracellular pH, ratios of phosphocreatine (PCr) to ATP and PCr to inorganic phosphate (Pi) as well as isometric tension were measured during 1 Hz sciatic nerve stimulation and during recovery in the calf muscles of mdx (a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy) and control mice. Tension did not decline significantly in either strain. The ratio of PCr/(PCr + Pi) was significantly reduced in mdx as against control muscle during exercise and recovery, but the ratio of PCr/ATP and the half-time for PCr recovery were similar in both strains. A reduction in the maximal activities of succinate dehydrogenase and succinate- cytochrome c reductase suggests that mitochondrial metabolism may be impaired. The similarity in PCr recovery times suggests that the muscle has adapted, making any impairment of oxidative metabolism negligible in the intact system. The rate of pH recovery is prolonged in mdx muscle and provides strong evidence for a decline in the capacity of dystrophic muscle to extrude proton equivalents. These data are compared with a previous study which used 10 Hz stimulation and also observed a slow pH recovery. The slow pH recovery could be explained by an elevation in intracellular sodium.},

@article{Fang2014,
abstract = {Because of long-range order and high chemical purity, organic crystals have exhibit unique properties and attracted a lot of interest for application in solid-state lasers. As optical gain materials, they exhibit high stimulated emission cross section and broad tunable wavelength emission as similar to their amorphous counterpart moreover, high purity and high order give them superior properties such as low scattering trap densities, high thermal stability, as well as highly polarized emission. As electronic materials, they are potentially able to support high current densities, thus making it possible to realize current driven lasers. This paper mainly describes recent research progress in organic semiconductor laser crystals. The building molecules, crystal growth methods, as well as their stimulated emission characteristics related with crystal structures are introduced; in addition, the current state-of-the-art in the field of crystal laser devices is reviewed. Furthermore, recent advances of crystal lasers at the nanoscale and single crystal light-emitting transistors (LETs) are presented. Finally, an outlook and personal view is provided on the further developments of laser crystals and their applications. Organic single crystals have attracted a lot of interest for novel optoelectronic devices. In this paper, recent research progress in organic semiconductor crystals for laser applications is reviewed. The features of crystals, their growth technologies, as well as laser resonators and corresponding fabrication methods are introduced. Crystal lasers at the nanoscale and electronically-driven light-emitting transistors are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {Abstract The study of photoexcitations in molecular aggregates faces the twofold problem of the increased computational cost associated with excited states and the complexity of the interactions among the constituent monomers. A mechanistic investigation of these processes requires the analysis of the intermolecular interactions, the effect of the environment, and 3D arrangements or crystal packing on the excited states. A considerable number of techniques have been tailored to navigate these obstacles; however, they are usually restricted to in-house codes and thus require a disproportionate effort to adopt by researchers approaching the field. Herein, we present the FRamewOrk for Molecular AGgregate Excitations (fromage), which implements a collection of such techniques in a Python library complemented with ready-to-use scripts. The program structure is presented and the principal features available to the user are described: geometrical analysis, exciton characterization, and a variety of ONIOM schemes. Each is illustrated by examples of diverse organic molecules in condensed phase settings. The program is available at https://github.com/Crespo-Otero-group/fromage.}

Eleven new conical intersection critical points were located at the CASSCF level, the connectivity was mapped and the energies refined with CASPT 2. There are two seam branches related with pairs of degenerate A1g/B2u and Eg states at D6h symmetry, respectively, and the two branches are connected by a seam segment of Cs symmetry. The global energy minimum of the seam is the half-boat shaped intersection that leads to a pre-fulvenic intermediate [I.J. Palmer, I.N. Ragazos, F. Bernardi, M. Olivucci, M.A. Robb, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115 (1993) 673]. Several other intersections that can lead to the same intermediate or vibrationally hot benzene lie in a range of 3.7eV above the global seam minimum. There is a recurrent connectivity pattern where permutationally isomeric seam segments are connected by intersections of a higher symmetry point group."

@article{Desiraju1989,
abstract = {Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons crystallize in four basic structure types which may be clearly differen- tiated by energetic and geometrical criteria. The major motifs in these four prototypes are the stack, or layer, and the glide, or herringbone. A study of 32 representative hydrocarbons shows that the adoption of one or the other structure type depends on the relative importance of C{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}C and C{\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered}H interactions and therefore on the number and positioning of C and H atoms in the molecule. Consequently, it is possible to consider part of the molecular free surface as 'stack promoting' and the rest as 'glide promoting'. Individual C and H atoms in a molecule may be assigned stack and glide factors based only on their atomic connec- tivity. Using these factors, a predictive mapping from molecular to crystal structure is attempted. Based as they are on molecular shape, the packing criteria proposed here provide a simple classification scheme and, in some cases, may be used to predict the crystal structures of other planar aromatic hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {Proton transfer is one of the most important elementary reactions in chemistry and biology. The role of proton in the course of proton transfer, whether it is active or passive, has been the subject of intense investigations. Here we demonstrate the active role of proton in the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) of 10-hydroxybenzo-[h]quinoline (HBQ). The ESIPT of HBQ proceeds in 12 6 Is, and the rate is slowed down to 25 +/- 5 fs for DBQ where the reactive hydrogen is replaced by deuterium. The results are consistent with the ballistic proton wave packet transfer within the experimental uncertainty. This ultrafast proton transfer leads to the coherent excitation of the vibrational modes of the product state. In contrast, ESIPT of 2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) is much slower at 62 fs and shows no isotope dependence implying complete passive role of the proton.},

abstract  ="The application of computational chemistry in resolving photochemical and photobiological problems depends on theoretical models and calculation strategies that allow an understanding of how and when the energy contained in a photon can be used or dissipated by a molecule. Progress in this arena has been the result of a scientific journey that can be traced from the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the concept of the “photochemical funnel”{,} and again from the 1980s and 1990s with the development and application of ab initio multiconfigurational quantum chemistry. Mainly following the viewpoint and contributions of the corresponding author (together with others){,} here we show that both the early and the ongoing research points to a central role of conical intersections in the molecular-level control of the selectivity and efficiency of photochemical reactions and internal conversion processes."}

abstract = {The implementation of an efficient program of the algebraic diagrammatic construction method for the polarisation propagator in third-order perturbation theory (ADC(3)) for the computation of excited states is reported. The accuracies of ADC(2) and ADC(3) schemes have been investigated with respect to Thiel's recently established benchmark set for excitation energies and oscillator strengths. The calculation of 141 vertical excited singlet and 71 triplet states of 28 small to medium-sized organic molecules has revealed that ADC(3) exhibits mean error and standard deviation of 0.12 ± 0.28 eV for singlet states and -0.18 ± 0.16 eV for triplet states when the provided theoretical best estimates are used as benchmark. Accordingly, the ADC(2)-s and ADC(2)-x calculations revealed accuracies of 0.22 ± 0.38 eV and -0.70 ± 0.37 eV for singlets and 0.12 ± 0.16 eV and -0.55 ± 0.20 eV for triplets, respectively. For a comparison of CC3 and ADC(3), only non-CC3 benchmark values were considered, which comprise 84 singlet states and 19 triplet states. For these singlet states CC3 exhibits an accuracy of 0.23 ± 0.21 eV and ADC(3) an accuracy of 0.08 ± 0.27 eV, and accordingly for the triplet states of 0.12 ± 0.10 eV and -0.10 ± 0.13 eV, respectively. Hence, based on the quality of the existing benchmark set it is practically not possible to judge whether ADC(3) or CC3 is more accurate, however, ADC(3) has a much larger range of applicability due to its more favourable scaling of O(N6) with system size. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The accuracy of three different complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field (CASSCF) methods is investigated for the electronically excited-state benchmark set of Schreiber, M.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 128, 134110. Comparison of the CASSCF linear response (LR) methods MC-RPA and MC-TDA and the state-averaged (SA) CASSCF method is made for 122 singlet excitation energies and 69 oscillator strengths. Of all CASSCF methods, when considering the complete test set, MC-RPA performs best for both excitation energies and oscillator strengths with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.74 eV and 51{\%}, respectively. MC-TDA and SA-CASSCF show a similar accuracy for the excitation energies with a MAE of ∼1 eV with respect to more accurate coupled cluster (CC3) excitation energies. The opposite trend is observed for the subset of n → $\pi$∗ excitation energies for which SA-CASSCF exhibits the least deviations (MAE 0.65 eV). By looking at s-tetrazine in more detail, we conclude that better performance for the n → $\pi$∗ SA-CASSCF excitation energies can be attributed to a fortunate error compensation. For oscillator strengths, SA-CASSCF performs worst for the complete test set (MAE 100{\%}) as well as for the subsets of n → $\pi$∗ (MAE 192{\%}) and $\pi$→ $\pi$∗ excitations (MAE 84.9{\%}). In general, CASSCF gives the worst performance for excitation energies of all excited-state ab initio methods considered so far due to lacking the major part of dynamic electron correlation, though MC-RPA and TD-DFT (BP86) show similar performance. Among all LR-type methods, LR-CASSCF oscillator strengths are the ones with the least accuracy for the same reason. As state-specific orbital relaxation effects are accounted for in LR-CASSCF, oscillator strengths are significantly more accurate than those of MS-CASPT2. Our findings should encourage further developments of response theory-based multireference methods with higher accuracy and feasibility.},

abstract = {Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed for the valence excited states of 28 medium-sized organic benchmark molecules using multistate multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and the augmented correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. They are compared with previously reported MS-CASPT2 results obtained with the smaller TZVP basis. The basis set extension from TZVP to aug-cc-pVTZ causes rather minor and systematic shifts in the vertical excitation energies that are normally slightly reduced (on average by 0.11 eV for the singlets and by 0.09 eV for the triplets), whereas the changes in the calculated oscillator strengths and dipole moments are somewhat more pronounced on a relative scale. These basis set effects at the MS-CASPT2 level are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those found at the coupled cluster level for the same set of benchmark molecules. The previously proposed theoretical best estimates (TBE-1) for the vertical excitation energies for 104 singlet and 63 triplet excited states of the benchmark molecules are upgraded by replacing TZVP with aug-cc-pVTZ data that yields a new reference set (TBE-2). Statistical evaluations of the performance of density functional theory (DFT) and semiempirical methods lead to the same ranking and very similar quantitative results for TBE-1 and TBE-2, with slightly better performance measures with respect to TBE-2. DFT/MRCI is most accurate among the investigated DFT-based approaches, while the OMx methods with orthogonalization corrections perform best at the semiempirical level. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) linear response method for the simulation of ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) absorption and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra of large open-shell molecules is presented. By using a one-index transformed Hamiltonian, the computation of the most time-consuming intermediates can be pursued in an integral-direct fashion, which allows us to employ the efficient resolution-of-the-identity and overlap-fitted chain-of-spheres approximation. For the iterative diagonalization, pairs of Hermitian and anti-Hermitian trial vectors are used which facilitate, on the one hand, an efficient solution of the pair-structured generalized eigenvalue problem in the reduced space, and on the other hand, make the full multiconfigurational random phase approximation as efficient as the corresponding Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Electronic transitions are analyzed and characterized in the particle-hole picture by natural transition orbitals that are introduced for CASSCF linear response theory. For a small organic radical, we can show that the accuracy of simulated UV/Vis absorption spectra with the CASSCF linear response approach is significantly improved compared to the popular state-averaged CASSCF method. To demonstrate the efficiency of the implementation, the 50 lowest roots of a large Ni triazole complex with 231 atoms are computed for the simulated UV/Vis and ECD spectra.},

abstract = {Mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree-Fock, semilocal density functional approximations, or semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) theories do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction). Inclusion of these effects is mandatory for realistic calculations on large or condensed chemical systems and for various intramolecular phenomena (thermochemistry). This Review describes the recent developments (including some historical aspects) of dispersion corrections with an emphasis on methods that can be employed routinely with reasonable accuracy in large-scale applications. The most prominent correction schemes are classified into three groups: (i) nonlocal, density-based functionals, (ii) semiclassical C6-based, and (iii) one-electron effective potentials. The properties as well as pros and cons of these methods are critically discussed, and typical examples and benchmarks on molecular complexes and crystals are provided. Although there are some areas for further improvement (robustness, many-body and short-range effects), the situation regarding the overall accuracy is clear. Various approaches yield long-range dispersion energies with a typical relative error of 5{\%}. For many chemical problems, this accuracy is higher compared to that of the underlying mean-field method (i.e., a typical semilocal (hybrid) functional like B3LYP).},

For all systems, increasing diffuseness of the basis introduces highly excited diffuse back-door intruder states, resulting in an alternately, ultimately divergent expansion. The divergence of the Moller-Plesset series does not invalidate the use of the second-order expansion; however, it questions the use of higher-order MP expansions in quantum chemical studies.},

@article{Zhang2018,
abstract = {Accurate and careful benchmarking of different density-functional approximations (DFAs) represents an important source of information for understanding DFAs and how to improve them. In this work we have studied the lattice constants, cohesive energies, and bulk moduli of 64 solids using six functionals, representing the local, semi-local, and hybrid DFAs on the first four rungs of Jacob's ladder. The set of solids considered consists of ionic crystals, semiconductors, metals, and transition metal carbides and nitrides. To minimize numerical errors and to avoid making further approximations, the full-potential, all-electron FHI-aims code has been employed, and all the reported cohesive properties include contributions from zero-point vibrations. Our assessment demonstrates that current DFAs can predict cohesive properties with mean absolute relative errors of 0.6{\%} for the lattice constant and 6{\%} for both the cohesive energy and the bulk modulus over the whole database of 64 solids. For semiconducting and insulating solids, the recently proposed SCAN meta-GGA functional represents a substantial improvement over the other functionals. However, when considering the different types of solids in the set, all of the employed functionals exhibit some variance in their performance. There are clear trends and relationships in the deviations of the cohesive properties, pointing to the need to consider, for example, long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions. This point is also demonstrated by consistent improvements in predictions for cohesive properties of semiconductors when augmenting GGA and hybrid functionals with a screened Tkatchenko-Scheffler vdW energy term.},

@article{Shao2020,
abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations are important for elucidating light-capturing mechanisms in photobiological systems. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has become a popular methodology because of its balance between accuracy and computational scaling, despite its problems in describing, for example, charge transfer states. As a step toward systematically understanding the performance of TDDFT calculations on biomolecular systems, we study here 17 commonly used density functionals, including seven long-range separated functionals, and compare the obtained results with excitation energies calculated at the approximate second order coupled-cluster theory level (CC2). The benchmarking set includes the first five singlet excited states of 11 chemical analogues of biochromophores from the green fluorescent protein, rhodopsin/bacteriorhodopsin (Rh/bR), and the photoactive yellow protein. We find that commonly used pure density functionals such as BP86, PBE, M11-L, and hybrid functionals with 20-25{\%} of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) have a tendency to consistently underestimate vertical excitation energies (VEEs) relative to the CC2 values, whereas hybrid density functionals with around 50{\%} HF exchange such as BHLYP, PBE50, and M06-2X and long-range corrected functionals such as CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$PBE, $\omega$PBEh, $\omega$B97X, $\omega$B97XD, BNL, and M11 overestimate the VEEs. We observe that calculations using the CAM-B3LYP and $\omega$PBEh functionals with 65{\%} and 100{\%} long-range HF exchange, respectively, lead to an overestimation of the VEEs by 0.2-0.3 eV for the benchmarking set. To reduce the systematic error, we introduce here two new empirical functionals, CAMh-B3LYP and $\omega$hPBE0, for which we adjusted the long-range HF exchange to 50{\%}. The introduced parameterization reduces the mean signed average (MSA) deviation to 0.07 eV and the root mean square (rms) deviation to 0.17 eV as compared to the CC2 values. In the present study, TDDFT calculations using the aug-def2-TZVP basis sets, the best performing functionals relative to CC2 are $\omega$hPBE0 (rms = 0.17, MSA = 0.06 eV); CAMh-B3LYP (rms = 0.16, MSA = 0.07 eV); and PBE0 (rms = 0.23, MSA =-0.14 eV). For the popular range-separated CAM-B3LYP functional, we obtain an rms value of 0.31 eV and an MSA value of 0.25 eV, which can be compared with the rms and MSA values of 0.37 and-0.31 eV, respectively, as obtained at the B3LYP level.},

@article{Cora2005,
abstract = {The performance of hybrid exchange functional is investigated within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT), in describing the properties of cubic and tetragonal ferroelectric phases of BaTiO3. A variable fraction $\xi$ of non-local HF exchange is mixed with Becke's GGA formulation, and coupled with the LYP correlation functional. Standard DFT functionals (LDA, PW, B3LYP) and uncorrelated HF are also added for comparison. Inclusion of the non-local HF exchange has a noticeable effect on the calculated electronic density, and several observables show clear trends as a function of the mixing parameter $\xi$; these include not only the band gap, but also lattice parameter and bulk modulus, structural distortions, relative ionic sizes, electronic polarizability and polarization of the tetragonal phase. In this context, it is shown that hybrid functionals yield results that are generally in better agreement with experiment than local (LDA and GGA) DFT formulations. A higher fraction of HF exchange than the 20{\%} optimized in the B3LYP functional for molecular systems is required in the solid state. This is due to the localization effect played by the Madelung field on the electronic distribution; in this situation, the self-interaction error in local DFT functionals is more pronounced, and is empirically corrected by a high fraction of exact HF exchange component in the hybrid functional. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis Group Ltd.},

@article{Selli2017,
abstract = {TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are nowadays considered fundamental building blocks for many technological applications. Morphology is found to play a key role with spherical NPs presenting higher binding properties and chemical activity. From the experimental point of view, the characterization of these nano-objects is extremely complex, opening a large room for computational investigations. In this work, TiO2 spherical NPs of different sizes (from 300 to 4000 atoms) have been studied with a two-scale computational approach. Global optimization to obtain stable and equilibrated nanospheres was performed with a self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) simulated annealing process, causing a considerable atomic rearrangement within the nanospheres. Those SCC-DFTB relaxed structures have been then optimized at the DFT(B3LYP) level of theory. We present a systematic and comparative SCC-DFTB vs DFT(B3LYP) study of the structural properties, with particular emphasis on the surface-to-bulk sites ratio, coordination distribution of surface sites, and surface energy. From the electronic point of view, we compare HOMO-LUMO and Kohn-Sham gaps, total and projected density of states. Overall, the comparisons between DFTB and hybrid density functional theory show that DFTB provides a rather accurate geometrical and electronic description of these nanospheres of realistic size (up to a diameter of 4.4 nm) at an extremely reduced computational cost. This opens for new challenges in simulations of very large systems and more extended molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {A benchmark set of 28 medium-sized organic molecules is assembled that covers the most important classes of chromophores including polyenes and other unsaturated aliphatic compounds, aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocycles, carbonyl compounds, and nucleobases. Vertical excitation energies and one-electron properties are computed for the valence excited states of these molecules using both multiconfigurational second-order perturbation theory, CASPT2, and a hierarchy of coupled cluster methods, CC2, CCSD, and CC3. The calculations are done at identical geometries (MP26-31 G*) and with the same basis set (TZVP). In most cases, the CC3 results are very close to the CASPT2 results, whereas there are larger deviations with CC2 and CCSD, especially in singlet excited states that are not dominated by single excitations. Statistical evaluations of the calculated vertical excitation energies for 223 states are presented and discussed in order to assess the relative merits of the applied methods. CC2 reproduces the CC3 reference data for the singlets better than CCSD. On the basis of the current computational results and an extensive survey of the literature, we propose best estimates for the energies of 104 singlet and 63 triplet excited states. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

We found that current polarizable {QM}/{MM} methods inadequately describe the potential energy surfaces in this system, particularly close to the electronic crossing, so we developed a new polarizable embedding method called dynamically weighted polarizable {QM}/{MM}.
