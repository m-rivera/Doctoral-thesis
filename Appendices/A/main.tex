\section{Crystal Structures}
\label{app:sec:cryst_struct}

The experimental crystal structures for HC1 and HC2 are accessible on the Cambridge Structural Database with codes 941991 and 1061608 respectively.\cite{Zhang2015}

\section{Absorption and Emission Spectra}
\label{app:sec:spectra}

To consider the effect of vibrations on the position of the absorption and emission maxima, we simulate both spectra with the nuclear ensemble approach as implemented in \texttt{Newton-X}.\cite{Crespo-Otero2012,newtonx} They are shown in Figure \ref{fig:spec}. For each scheme, the monomer was first optimised to the \textbf{FC} and \textbf{K*} geometries for absorption and emission. The vibrational modes were calculated using $\omega$B97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) in \texttt{Gaussian}\cite{g16} in the presence of the point charges from the embedding model.

\section{Population Analysis for Aggregates}
\label{app:sec:pop_analysis_aggregates}

RESP charges respond directly to the electrostatic environment of the atom. As such they are a measure of the quality of the embedding method. In Figure \ref{fig:chargesFC} we compare the RESP charges of notable atoms on monomers embedded in different charge backgrounds to those calculated in tetramers embedded using \EEC{}. In this case the central molecule is in the \textbf{FC} geometry. The results for \textbf{K*} are in Figure \ref{fig:chargesK}.

In the top row, the molecule is optimised with \EEC{} and in the bottom with \SCEEC{}-S$_1$. We compare the charge obtained from the monomer population analysis of in vacuum S$_0$, S$_1$ and in EEC and \SCEEC{}-S$_1$. The absolute average charge in the tetramer is indicated by horizontal ticks, positive values are in grey and negative ones in black. The atom labels are the ones found in Figure 1 of the main text.}

\section{Vertical Excitation for Aggregate}
\label{app:sec:tetramer_vert}

The bright state of \HCC{} has a different identity depending on the charge background. We illustrate this in Figs \ref{fig:hc1abs} and \ref{fig:hc2abs}.

\section{Exciton Coupling in Dimers}
\label{app:sec:troisi_J}


Dimeric exciton couplings were computed using the diabatisation scheme devised by AragÃ³ and Troisi.\cite{Arag2015} In this scheme, a diabatisation excited state property is selected. (1) It is first evaluated for the dimer in S$_1$ and S$_2$, along with the excited state energy. (2) It is also calculated for the constituent monomers of the dimer. (3) Then, a singular-value decomposition is employed to determine the matrix which best transforms the property from the adiabatic to the diabatic basis. (4) Finally, the newly obtained diabatisation matrix is used to transform the adiabatic Hamiltonian into the diabatic one. The latter's off-diagonal elements are the desired J exciton coupling values. 

More details are offered in section \ref{sec:detail_js}. The results for HC1 and HC2 are shown in Table \ref{tab:couplings}. Also shown are the couplings obtained using half of the energy gap between S\textsubscript{1} and S\textsubscript{2} in the dimer.
